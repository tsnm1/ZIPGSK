Description: A novel knockoff method for enhancing multi-source count data is proposed. This method is primarily based on the Gaussian copula framework of the zero-inflated Poissonâ€“Gamma (ZIPG) distribution for knockoff generation, and is combined with the Simultaneous Knockoff method to address variable selection in multi-source data.
